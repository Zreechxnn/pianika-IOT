# Pianika-IOT

The Pianika IOT project emulates a simple digital piano using an Arduino microcontroller. It allows you to play musical notes (DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA, SI) by pressing physical buttons, which trigger sound output through a connected speaker or buzzer.

---

You can play the following musical notes:
- **DO**
- **RE**
- **MI**
- **FA**
- **SOL**
- **LA**
- **SI**

## Features

- **Play Notes**: Seven musical notes (DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA, SI) triggered by buttons.
- **Customizable Frequencies**: Adjust note frequencies in the code for specific sounds.
- **Minimalist Design**: Easy-to-assemble circuit suitable for beginners.

## Components

- Arduino Board
- Push Buttons (7 units for each musical note)
- Resistors (or use Arduino's internal pull-up resistors)
- Speaker/Buzzer
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Diagram

## How to Use

1. **Build the Circuit**: Follow the circuit diagram to connect the components properly.
2. **Upload the Code**: Flash the provided Arduino code to your board.
3. **Test and Play**: Press each button to play its corresponding musical note.

## Notes

- Double-check your wiring to avoid short circuits or incorrect connections.
- Modify note frequencies or delay times in the code for different behaviors.

## Future Improvements

- **Extended Octave**: Add more keys to cover a full musical octave.
- **Keypad Input**: Use a keypad to reduce the number of physical connections.
- **Volume Control**: Integrate a potentiometer for adjustable volume.
- **Visual Feedback**: Add LEDs to indicate the pressed note visually.
