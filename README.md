# pianika-IOT

This project simulates a digital piano using an Arduino microcontroller. Each key represents a musical note that produces a sound through a speaker when pressed.

Features

Play musical notes (DO, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA, SI) using physical buttons.

Configurable notes using predefined frequencies.

Simple circuit design for easy replication.

Components

Arduino Board

Push Buttons (7 units)

Resistors (Pull-up resistors or use internal pull-up)

Speaker/Buzzer

Jumper Wires

Breadboard

Circuit Diagram



How to Use

Assemble the circuit according to the diagram.

Upload the Arduino code to your board.

Press the buttons to play corresponding notes.

Notes

Ensure correct wiring to prevent short circuits.

Adjust note frequencies or delay times in the code to modify behavior.

Future Improvements

Add more keys for a full octave.

Use a keypad to reduce the number of connections.

Implement volume control using a potentiometer.
